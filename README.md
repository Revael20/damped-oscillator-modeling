# PINN Damped Harmonic Oscillator (Experimental Data)

This project uses a **Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN)** to model the damped harmonic motion of a metal sphere in water, based on real experimental data. The neural network is trained to satisfy both physical laws (ODEs) and data measurements.

---

## 📊 Problem Description

We analyzed an experiment of a metal sphere oscillating vertically in water. The motion follows a second-order differential equation representing a **damped harmonic oscillator**:

d²y/dt² + 2ζω dy/dt + ω²y = 0

Where:
- y(t): position over time
- ζ: damping ratio
- ω: natural frequency

## 🧠 PINN Model

We used PyTorch to define a fully connected neural network that:
- Takes time \( t \) as input
- Outputs predicted position \( y(t) \)
- Computes derivatives using `torch.autograd` for \( \frac{dy}{dt} \) and \( \frac{d^2y}{dt^2} \)
- Minimizes a **hybrid loss**:
  - Physics loss (ODE residual)
  - Data loss (difference between prediction and experimental data)
  - Optional regularization on learnable parameters

## ⚙️ Learnable Parameters

The model learns:
- \( \zeta \): damping ratio (soft-bounded between 0 and 0.9)
- \( \omega \): frequency (positive)
- \( C \): vertical offset, since the data doesn’t start at 0

This makes the PINN both a data-fitting and physics-solving tool.

---

## 🧩 Notes

- We chose a hybrid loss to balance physics and data.
- A regularization term on \( \zeta, \omega \) is optional.
- The network sometimes converges to incorrect physical parameters if data is noisy or poorly scaled — this is an active challenge in PINN research.

---

## 📈 Results

- The final output shows close alignment between experimental measurements and the PINN prediction.
- The model attempts to discover the true damping ratio and frequency just from data + differential equations.
